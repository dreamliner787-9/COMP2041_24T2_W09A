This week's tutoring is focused on an intotroduction to python and regular expressions in python.
Make sure students know how to run a python program.
Make sure students know how to import the re module and use the regex functions.

Q1. Use the `#!/usr/bin/env python3` hashbang for python. Demo `python3` hashbang doesn't work.
    Demo `which python3` trick.

Q2. CSE uses Python 3.9, show student 3.9 specific documentations: https://docs.python.org/3.9/

Q3. Demo help expression

Q4. Demo python3 interpreter executing line by line.

Q5. live coding.
Talk about weak-typing compared to C and type inference.
Talk about importance of indentations. 
Demo list-slicing notation.
Demo optional `end` argument to print.
Demo the content of sys.argv

Q6. live coding.
Demo string formatting and string concatenation

Q7. live coding. less important.

Q8. more live coding... compute ascii value with ord() and reconstruct char from ascii number with chr()

Q9. 

Q10. import re
Q11. 
search is the most like the grep command.
search will find a match anywhere in the string.

match will only find a match at the beginning of the string.
It is the same as using search with the ^ anchor.

fullmatch will only find a match at both the beginning and at the end of the string.
It is the same as using search with both the ^ and $ anchors.

A match object has a number of useful attributes:
Match.span() - the starting and ending index of the match
Match.re.pattern - the regex pattern
Match.string - the original string
Match.group(0) - the match
Match.group(N) - capture groups
