2. What is an operating system?
    An operating system is a piece of software that manages the hardware of a computer and provides an interface to the programs that run on the computer.

    This means that user level programs do not need to know the details of the hardware.
    They use code that interfaces with the operating system (syscalls).
    And the operating system handles the details of the hardware.

    This means that user level programs can be written once and run on many different computers.

3. What OS do CSE lab computers run?
    A flavour of Linux

4. What is a filter program? What is a regular expression (regex)?
    Filters:
        - Filter is a program that transforms a byte stream
        - Reads bytes from their standard input or specified files, then perform useful transformation on the stream, and write the transformed bytes to standard output or specified files
        - Examples: `cat`, `grep`, `wc`, `tr`, `head`/`tail`, `cut`, `sort`, `uniq`, `sed`, `find`, `join`, `paste`, `tee`, and `xargs`

    Grep:
        A program that prints lines from its input that match a given regex.
        Useful flags:
        - `-E` matches full POSIX regex. Always use it.
        - `-i` ignores upper/lower case `grep -i 'h' file.txt`
        - `-v` displays lines that do not match the pattern `grep -v 'h' file.txt`. Invert the match.

    Regular expressions:
        Concise powerful notation for *matching* a set of strings.
        Unless a character has a special meaning, it matches itself `a` matches `a`.

        a*     Matches zero or more repetition of 'a': '', 'a', 'aa', 'aaa', ...
        a+     Matches one or more repetition of 'a': 'a', 'aa', 'aaa', ...
        a?     Matches zero or one 'a'
        a|b    Matches 'a' or 'b'
        ()     Grouping: (a*|b|c+)
        a{n}   Matches n repetitions of 'a'. a{5} matches only 'aaaaa'

        ^a     Forces a to match at the beginning of a line
        a$     Forces a to match at the end of a line

        [ab]   Matches a or b
        [^a]   Matches anything except a

        a{n,m} Matches n to m repetitions of a
        p{n,}  Matches n or more repetitions of a
        p{,m}  Matches m or less repetitions of a

        \s     Matches any whitespace characters
	\d     Matches any digits. Equivalent to [0-9]
        .      Matches any character

5. Write a regex to match:
    C preprocessor commands in a C program source file.
        '^#'

    All the lines in a C program except preprocessor commands.
        '^[^#]'

    All lines in a C program with trailing white space (one or more white space at the end of line).
        '\s+$'

    The names "Barry", "Harry", "Larry" and "Parry".
        '^[BHLP]arry$'

    A string containing the word "hello" followed, some time later, by the word "world".
        'hello.*world'

    The word "calendar" and mis-spellings where 'a' is replaced with 'e' or vice-versa.
        'c[ae]l[ae]nd[ae]r'

    A list of positive integers separated by commas, e.g. 2,4,8,16,32
        ([0-9])|([1-9][0-9]*)(,([0-9])|([1-9][0-9]*))*

    A C string whose last character is newline.
        '"[^"]*\\n"'


6. You are in the COMP2041 final exam and you forgot some grep options, where can you access the documentation?
       man grep

7. Why does this command seem to be taking a long time to run: `grep -E hello`
       Because by default, grep (and other filter programs) wait for input from standard input (which is the terminal).

8. Why won't this command work: `grep -E int main program.c`
       Because the space is a special character in shell that separate the argumnets into a program. So in this problem, it is saying "find 'int' in the file main and program.c", which is not what we want. We want to find 'int main' in the file program.c

       To solve this, we put our regex in quotation which make it one argument: `grep -E "int main" program.c`

9. This regular expression [0-9]*.[0-9]* is intended to match floating point numbers such as '42.5'. Is it appropriate?

   	Nope, for example, it matches "comp.2041", to fix this, we use a better regexp that only matches numbers:

	([0-9]|[1-9][0-9]+)(,([0-9]|[1-9][0-9]+))*
